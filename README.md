# CSCI340_ProjectEC

Welcome to CSCI340_ProjectEC! This project is a basic shell which was created as an extra-credit project for CSCI 340.

## Quick-Start Guide

To build the program, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EGuthrieWasTaken/CSCI340_ProjectEC.git
cd CSCI340_ProjectEC
make
```

Running the program uses the following syntax:

```bash
# Make sure you are in the same directory as CSCI340_ProjectEC.out
./CSCI340_ProjectEC.out [batch_file]
```

Note that this program will accept either no additional arguments which will cause the program to start in interactive mode, or a single argument may be specified. That argument must be the qualified path to a batch file containing commands to be run, one per line.
